# 🔧 Railway Deployment Issue - Summary & Fix

## What Happened?

You tried to deploy your Movr app to Railway, but the deployment **failed** with this error:

```
✖ Railpack could not determine how to build the app.
⚠ Script start.sh not found
```

## Why Did It Fail?

Your repository is a **monorepo** containing:
- 📱 **Flutter Frontend** (Android, iOS, Web, Linux, macOS, Windows)
- 🚀 **FastAPI Backend** (Python, PostgreSQL, Redis)

When you pushed to GitHub and Railway tried to deploy:

1. Railway saw the entire repo at the root directory
2. Railpack (Railway's build detector) analyzed the contents
3. It found Flutter files (`lib/`, `pubspec.yaml`), Backend files, and more
4. **Confused** - it didn't know which app to build or how
5. ❌ **Failed** - gave up with "can't determine build type"

## The Fix ✅

I created 2 files to tell Railway **exactly what to build**:

### File 1: `railway.toml` (NEW)
```toml
[build]
dockerfile = "backend/Dockerfile"    ← Use this specific Dockerfile
context = "backend"                  ← Build from backend folder only
```

This tells Railway: *"Ignore Flutter files, deploy only the backend folder"*

### File 2: `backend/Dockerfile` (UPDATED)
Changed the startup command to respect Railway's PORT environment variable:

**Before:**
```dockerfile
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}"]
```

This allows Railway to assign any port it wants (Railway provides a `PORT` env var).

## What You Need To Do

### 1. ✅ Commit the changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway monorepo deployment - deploy backend only"
git push origin main
```

### 2. ✅ Railway auto-deploys
Railway watches your GitHub repo. When you push, it automatically:
1. Detects the `railway.toml` file
2. Reads it and knows to deploy only `backend/`
3. Starts the build process
4. Deploys your FastAPI backend ✨

### 3. ✅ Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
Monitor in Railway Dashboard:
- Dashboard → Your Service → Deployments tab
- Watch the status change: `Building...` → `Deploying...` → `Running ✅`

### 4. ✅ Get your production URL
Once deployed, Railway gives you a URL like:
- **`https://movr-backend.up.railway.app`**

Or if you configured a custom domain:
- **`https://your-domain.com`**

## Verify It Works

Test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://movr-backend.up.railway.app/health

# API documentation (open in browser)
https://movr-backend.up.railway.app/docs

# API root info
curl https://movr-backend.up.railway.app/
```

All should return data! ✨

## What Happens Next?

Once backend is deployed:

1. ✅ Backend is live and accessible remotely
2. ⏳ Update Flutter app URLs to point to production
3. 📚 Follow: `FLUTTER_PRODUCTION_API_UPDATE.md`
4. 🎮 Rebuild Flutter app with production URL
5. 🎉 Show your supervisor the live app!

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Build still fails** | Check Railway Deployments logs - likely missing env vars (DATABASE_URL, etc) |
| **API returns errors** | Check Railway environment variables are set correctly |
| **Can't access URL** | Wait a bit longer for deployment to complete, or check Railway dashboard |
| **Port conflicts** | ✅ Fixed by the new Dockerfile - it respects Railway's PORT variable |
