# 🚀 NEXT STEPS - Fix Your Railway Deployment (5 minutes)

## Status
Your Railway deployment **failed** because it tried to build the entire monorepo instead of just the backend.

✅ **I've fixed it for you!** Two files are ready.

---

## Action Items (In Order)

### ✅ Step 1: Review What I Fixed (1 min)
1. Open `DEPLOYMENT_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md` - Understand the problem
2. Open `RAILWAY_MONOREPO_FIX.md` - See detailed fixes

### ✅ Step 2: Commit the Fixes (2 min)
```bash
cd c:\Users\oreol\Documents\Projects\Movr
git status          # See the new/modified files
git add .           # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Fix Railway monorepo deployment - deploy backend only"
git push origin main  # Push to GitHub
```

### ✅ Step 3: Trigger Deployment (1 min)
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your Movr project
3. Click the "Backend" service
4. Click "Deployments" tab
5. Look for a new deployment starting (Railway auto-triggered by your push)
6. Click it to see build logs in real-time

### ✅ Step 4: Wait for Success (2-3 min)
Railway will:
1. See your `railway.toml` file
2. Build from `backend/` folder only ✅
3. Deploy the FastAPI app ✅
4. Show you a public URL ✅

Watch the status: `Building...` → `Deploying...` → `Running` ✅

### ✅ Step 5: Get Your Production URL
Once deployed, Railway shows you a URL like:
```
https://movr-backend.up.railway.app
```

**Save this URL!** You'll need it next.

## Verify It Works (30 seconds)

Open these in your browser (replace URL with yours):

1. **Health Check**: https://movr-backend.up.railway.app/health
   - Should show: `{"status":"ok"}`

2. **API Docs**: https://movr-backend.up.railway.app/docs
   - Should show Swagger UI with all endpoints

✅ If both work, your backend is live!

---

## What's Next?

Once backend is running:

1. 📝 Update Flutter app to use production URL
   - Follow: `FLUTTER_PRODUCTION_API_UPDATE.md`
   
2. 🔨 Rebuild Flutter app
   
3. 🎉 Show your supervisor!

## Files Changed

| File | Status | What It Does |
|------|--------|------------|
| `railway.toml` | ✨ NEW | Tells Railway to deploy backend only |
| `backend/Dockerfile` | 🔧 UPDATED | Respects Railway's PORT environment variable |

---

## Troubleshooting

**If build still fails:**
1. Check Railway Deployments logs
2. Look for errors about:
   - Missing `DATABASE_URL` → Add env var in Railway
   - Missing `SECRET_KEY` → Add env var in Railway
   - Port issues → ✅ Fixed by new Dockerfile
3. Contact support with the error message

**If you need to rollback:**
1. Railway Dashboard → Deployments
2. Find previous working deployment
3. Click menu → Redeploy
