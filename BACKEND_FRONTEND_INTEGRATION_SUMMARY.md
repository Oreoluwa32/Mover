# Backend-Frontend Integration Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified
Your application was returning **422 Unprocessable Entity** errors because the frontend was sending incomplete data to the backend registration endpoint.

### Root Cause
The backend expected these fields for registration:
- `email` ✓ (being sent)
- `password` ✓ (being sent)
- `first_name` ✗ (MISSING)
- `last_name` ✗ (MISSING)
- `phone` ✗ (MISSING)
- `role` ✗ (MISSING)

But the frontend was only sending `email` and `password`.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend - Registration Screen Enhanced
**File:** `lib/presentation/create_account_screen/create_account_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added First Name input field
- ✅ Added Last Name input field
- ✅ Added Phone Number input field
- ✅ Updated form validation to check all fields
- ✅ Updated API request to include all required fields
- ✅ Added proper error handling with better error messages

**New Request Format:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "role": "customer"
}
```

### 2. Frontend - Login Screen Fixed
**File:** `lib/presentation/sign_in_screen/sign_in_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed response parsing from backend
- ✅ Changed from `responseData['token']['key']` to `responseData['access_token']`
- ✅ Added `refresh_token` storage
- ✅ Improved error handling for API responses
- ✅ Added proper error field parsing (`detail` instead of `error`)

**Backend Response Format:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800
}
```

### 3. Backend - Google Sign-In Endpoint Added
**File:** `backend/app/api/routes/auth.py`

**New Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/google-signin`

**Functionality:**
- ✅ Accepts Google ID token and user data
- ✅ Creates new user if doesn't exist
- ✅ Returns JWT tokens for existing users
- ✅ Validates user active status and ban status
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "id_token": "google_id_token_here",
  "email": "user@gmail.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

### 4. Frontend - Google Sign-In Integration Enhanced
**File:** `lib/domain/googleauth/google_auth_helper.dart`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `authenticateWithBackend()` method
- ✅ Extracts ID token from Google Sign-In
- ✅ Sends data to new `/api/v1/auth/google-signin` endpoint
- ✅ Returns auth tokens for secure storage

**Files Updated:**
- `lib/presentation/create_account_screen/create_account_screen.dart`
  - ✅ Integrated backend authentication
  - ✅ Stores tokens securely
  - ✅ Proper loading states and error handling
  
- `lib/presentation/sign_in_screen/sign_in_screen.dart`
  - ✅ Full Google Sign-In workflow
  - ✅ Device memory service integration
  - ✅ Proper navigation after authentication

### 5. Backend - Schema Updated
**File:** `backend/app/schemas/user.py`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `GoogleAuthRequest` schema
- ✅ Validates email, first_name, last_name, id_token

## Production Configuration Needed

### For Android
1. Generate release key SHA-1 fingerprint
2. Add it to Google Cloud Console for Android OAuth
3. Download `google-services.json`
4. Place in `android/app/`

### For iOS
1. Get iOS Bundle ID: `com.example.new-project` (or your app ID)
2. Create iOS OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Add to Xcode project

### For Backend (Render)
1. Set environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_long_random_secret
   JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

2. Ensure database tables are created:
   ```bash
   python -m alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Registration Flow
- [ ] Fill in all fields: email, first name, last name, phone, password
- [ ] Click "Get Started"
- [ ] Success message appears
- [ ] Check backend logs show "New user registered"

### ✅ Email/Password Login
- [ ] Enter registered email and password
- [ ] Click "Sign in"
- [ ] Should see "Sign-in successful" toast
- [ ] Redirects to Select Plan screen
- [ ] Tokens stored in secure storage

### ✅ Google Sign-In (Both Screens)
- [ ] Click "Sign up with Google" or "Sign in with Google"
- [ ] Select Google account
- [ ] User data extracted and sent to backend
- [ ] Tokens stored in secure storage
- [ ] Redirects to Select Plan screen
- [ ] Check backend logs show "Google user authenticated"

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Try duplicate email → See appropriate error message
- [ ] Try invalid email format → Form validation catches it
- [ ] Try short password → Form validation catches it
- [ ] Try phone number < 10 digits → Form validation catches it
- [ ] Try Google Sign-In without Google account → Cancels gracefully

## API Endpoints Summary

All endpoints require requests to: `https://movr-api.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/`

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status Code |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| `/register` | POST | Register new user | 201 Created |
| `/login` | POST | Login with email/password | 200 OK |
| `/google-signin` | POST | Google authentication | 200 OK |
| `/refresh` | POST | Refresh JWT token | 200 OK |

---

## Important Notes

1. **Database Sync:** Ensure your backend database is running and accessible
2. **Token Expiration:** Access tokens expire in 30 minutes (configurable)
3. **Refresh Tokens:** Use these to get new access tokens without re-logging in
4. **Security:** All endpoints use HTTPS in production
5. **CORS:** Configured for your frontend domain

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 422 Errors?
1. Check all fields are being sent (email, phone, first_name, last_name, password)
2. Verify phone number is at least 10 characters
3. Verify password is at least 8 characters
4. Check backend logs on Render for more details

### Google Sign-In Not Working?
1. Verify SHA-1 fingerprint in Google Cloud Console (Android)
2. Verify Bundle ID and Info.plist (iOS)
3. Check network request in browser dev tools (Web)
4. Ensure google_sign_in package is properly initialized

### Tokens Not Persisting?
1. Check flutter_secure_storage permissions
2. Verify keys being used match across app (should be 'auth_token' and 'refresh_token')
3. Check device storage isn't full
