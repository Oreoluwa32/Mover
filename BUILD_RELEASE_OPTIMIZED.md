# Building Optimized Release APK for Movr

## 🚀 Commands to Build Optimized APK

### Option 1: Standard Release Build (Recommended)
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

**Output:** `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

---

### Option 2: Split Release Builds by Architecture (Best for Distribution)

This creates smaller APKs for different device architectures:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

**Outputs:**
- `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` (older devices)
- `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` (modern devices)
- `app-x86-release.apk` (emulators/older tablets)

**Benefits:**
- Smaller individual APKs (30-50% size reduction)
- Faster downloads for end users
- Better for Play Store distribution

---

### Option 3: Advanced Optimized Build
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk \
  --release \
  --split-per-abi \
  --tree-shake-icons \
  --obfuscate \
  --split-debug-info=debug_info
```

**Flags Explanation:**
- `--split-per-abi` - Create separate APKs per CPU architecture
- `--tree-shake-icons` - Remove unused Material icons (saves ~2-3MB)
- `--obfuscate` - Minify code (hard to reverse engineer)
- `--split-debug-info` - Extract debug symbols (reduces APK by ~20%)

---

### Option 4: Build App Bundle (For Google Play Store)
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Output:** `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

**Benefits:**
- Recommended by Google Play
- Automatically optimizes for each device configuration
- Best file size optimization (~20-30% smaller than universal APK)
- Users get exactly what they need for their device

---

## 📋 Pre-Build Checklist

Before building, ensure:

- [ ] All debugging code is removed (`debugPrint`, `print` statements)
- [ ] `debugShowCheckedModeBanner` is false (already done in main.dart)
- [ ] Performance monitoring is disabled
- [ ] Sensitive APIs keys are properly secured
- [ ] All tests pass: `flutter test`

## 🔧 Recommended Build for Your Friend

Since your friend has performance issues, use:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

Then give him the **arm64-v8a** variant (if his device is modern) or **armeabi-v7a** (if older).

**Find the APKs at:**
```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

## 📊 Expected Results

| Build Type | File Size | Performance |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Standard APK | ~50-70MB | Good |
| Split APKs (arm64-v8a) | ~20-30MB | Excellent |
| With obfuscate | ~18-25MB | Best |
| App Bundle | ~15-20MB | Best (Play Store only) |

## 🎯 Best Practices for Your Friend's Device

1. **Clean before building**: `flutter clean` removes old build artifacts
2. **Use latest Flutter**: `flutter upgrade`
3. **Update dependencies**: `flutter pub upgrade`
4. **Target API 21+**: Ensures compatibility with older devices

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Build Issues

### Build fails with "Gradle" errors
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### "Generated plugin" errors
```bash
flutter pub get
cd android
./gradlew build
cd ..
flutter build apk --release
```

### Out of memory during build
Add to `android/build.gradle`:
```gradle
allprojects {
  gradle.projectsEvaluated {
    tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
      options.compilerArgs.add('-Xmx2048m')
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📱 Installing on Friend's Device

### Via USB
```bash
flutter install --release
```

### Via File Transfer
1. Build the APK
2. Transfer `app-release.apk` to device
3. On device: Settings → Apps → Install Unknown Apps → Allow for file manager
4. Open file manager, tap the APK to install

---

## 📈 Performance Testing After Build

Ask your friend to:

1. **Clear app cache**: Settings → Apps → Movr → Storage → Clear Cache
2. **Uninstall and reinstall** the new version
3. **Test key features**:
   - Home screen with map (most demanding)
   - Scrolling through lists
   - Navigation between screens
   - Location updates

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ Obfuscation enabled (code is minified)
- ✅ Debug symbols extracted (smaller APK)
- ✅ All APIs are secure in release mode
- ❌ Don't commit debug APKs to version control

---

## 📞 If Performance Still Issues

1. Check if friend's device has:
   - Enough storage (< 500MB free can cause lag)
   - Disabled apps running in background
   - Updated OS/security patches

2. Ask friend to:
   - Clear app cache after install
   - Restart device
   - Check available RAM (Settings → About)

3. Use Flutter DevTools to profile:
   ```bash
   flutter pub global activate devtools
   flutter run --profile
   # Open http://localhost:9100 in browser
   ```

---

## ✅ Summary

**For your friend's device, use:**
```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

This provides the best balance of **performance** and **compatibility**.
